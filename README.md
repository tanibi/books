# Books

## Why I like reading books?
I always liked reading books especially storybooks. I still remember my childhood self fervently turning the pages of my books as the story unfolded. I don't read books as much nowadays but I would like to get back in the habit of doing so and I would encourage others to do so. When I read I feel like I am transported to another reality. It's like being a witness to someone else's every aspect of life or story. It also helps me to broaden my imagination and see things through differnt perspective. All in all, I just enjoy reading!
